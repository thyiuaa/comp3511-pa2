# The input file for banker's algorithm
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored

# file format:
# Line 1 describes the algorithm
# Line 2 is the number of resource type (m)
# Line 3 is the number of process (n)
# Line 4 is the available vector (m non-negative integers)
# Line 5 to 5+n-1: Allocation matrix, each line has m non-negative integers
# Line 5+n to 5+2n-1: Max matrix, each line has m non-negative integers
# Line 5+2n: Request Process ID
# Line 5+2n+1: Request vector (m non-negative integers)
